# Cover-Letter-Generator
This is a cover letter generator that is made custom for myself. All I need to do to make a cover letter is input company name, position, location and copy and paste the qualification section. 

Qualification Frequency.ipynb is the code I used to determine what are the common qualifications that companies in my prefered field use.

Cover Letter Generator.ipynb is the generator where you input some basic information and it will spit out a professional quality cover letter.

cover_letter.txt is the cover letter created txt file.
