Dear ABC.Co hiring manager,

The purpose of this letter is to apply for a CEO position at ABC.Co in Edmonton,
AB. When I found your job advertised on Google, I was very excited as I have
a great interest in this field, and I believe my skillset strongly matches
the qualifications. Moreover, I believe that this would be an extraordinary
opportunity to further develop my skills in a workplace environment.

• I am currently enrolled in my third year of the Computing Science Specialization
program at the University of Alberta. The focus of my studies is in machine-learning.
• I have developed excellent communication skills from working with clients
to build schedules, hiring and directing employees, collaborating with other
developers in various hackathons, and developing Rolly Road with a team.
• I have excellent problem-solving skills that I developed through coding, practicing
math and being an avid chess player, where I am around the 95th percentile
for rated players on chess.com.
• I have a basic understanding of Reinforcement Learning that I gained by completing
Cmput 365 - Reinforcement Learning at the UofA.

Sincerely,

Shea McCormack
